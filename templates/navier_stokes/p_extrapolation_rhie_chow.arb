MARKDOWN
Here we link the pressure gradient (contained within <dynamic_force_f>) to the boundary velocity using the previously calculated rhie-chow interpolation terms.  In effect, adds a link between the pressure and velocity on the boundary.

Note that the <u_f_{correction}> term is based on <dynamic_force_f_{correction}>, which for boundary cells equates to the difference between <dynamic_force_f> and <dynamic_force_c> (component) evaluated in the downcell, as celldiv applied in a boundary cell automatically takes its value from the adjacent domain cell.

# alter the region <correctionfaces> so that it includes the boundaries
FACE_REGION <correctionfaces> "all" ON <allfaces>

# this needs to be fixed up possibly so that direction is consistent with dxunit?
FACE_EQUATION <equation> "<u_f>-faceave[downcell](dot(<u[l=:]>,cellave[lastface](<facenorm[l=:]>)))-<u_f_{correction}>" ON <region> # pressure gradient next to wall set so that dynamic pressure gradient inext to wall is zero
