MARKDOWN
Here we link the pressure gradient (contained within <dynamic_force_f>) to the boundary velocity using the previously calculated rhie-chow interpolation terms.  In effect, adds a link between the pressure and velocity on the boundary.

Note that the <u_f_{correction}> term is based on <p_error>, which for boundary cells equates to the difference between <dynamic_force_f> and <dynamic_force_c> (component) evaluated in the downcell, as celldiv applied in a boundary cell automatically takes its value from the adjacent domain cell.
