MARKDOWN
These strings are the defaults used by the navier-stokes templates files if not explicitly set by the user
They specify a steady-state solution to the navier-stokes equations, with uniform viscosity and density

Some of these use both comment and flag type variables, which requires three things to be set for each option.  The comment type variables will eventually be phased out, but are still required for many of the template files.
