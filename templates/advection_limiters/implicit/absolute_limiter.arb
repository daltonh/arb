# this file produces a limiter (<phi limiter>) that can be used to limit advective quantities

# to use these limiters for a general cell-centred variable <foo> say you need to:
# INCLUDE_ROOT "limiters_2d"
# INCLUDE "absolute_limiter" R <phi W <foo
# these will produce a CELL_DERIVED <foo limiter> on <all cells>
# a byproduct is the CELL_DERIVED <foo limiter grad[l=:]> vectors which can also be reused in the advection calculation, ie
# FACE_DERIVED <foo_f> "faceave[advection](<foo>,<u_f>,<foo limiter>,gradient[l=1]=<foo limiter gradient[l=1]>,gradient[l=2]=<foo limiter gradient[l=2]>)"

# these statements reference the regions <domain>, <all cells> and <all faces> so if non-standard regions are being used these will also have to be replaced
# the advective flux is assumed to be the face variable <u_f>, so again if this isn't used it will need to be replaced by an alternative velocity

# the relative_limiter file is almost the same, except for the inclusion of the relative_limits.arb file

# the only difference between 2d and 3d is in the limiter_gradients.arb file
