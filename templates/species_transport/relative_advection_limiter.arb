MARKDOWN
Here we setup an implicit relative limiter for <c_/species>, adding the necessary suffixes to all of the variables used in the limiter calculation

# first do the replacement of <phi
REPLACEMENTS R '<phi_' W '<c_'

# now add the species suffix to all variables used on the advection scheme that are specific to each species
# we do this by first defining the variable list <<replacment_variables>> here, so that the scope of this variable is local to this file
REPLACEMENTS R "<<replacement_variables>>" W ''
# the actual values are set by a REPLACEMENT SUBSTITUTE command in the following template file
