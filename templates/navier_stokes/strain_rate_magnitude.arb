# here we calculate the 'magnitude of the strain rate tensor', as used for example in generalised non-Newtonian fluids
# for the specific constants and form employed here refer to Bird, Stewart and Lightfoot (2002) p 241, where the strain rate tensor does not have a half multiplier, and the strain rate magnitude is defined as the square root of the second invariant of this strain rate tensor

# the strain rate tensor is calculated from the stress tensor template using a few substitutions
