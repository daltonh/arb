MARKDOWN
These strings are the defaults used by the navier-stokes templates files if not explicitly set by the user
They specify a steady-state solution to the navier-stokes equations, with uniform viscosity and density

Now moving to flags, as in `<<uniformviscosity>>` rather than the comment strings.
