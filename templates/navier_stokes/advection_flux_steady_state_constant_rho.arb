# this now chooses between the steady-state and transient advection_flux files based on the transient navier-stokes comment string
# these comment strings should be set from either constants, transient_setup or transient_dynamic_setup
# both files assume constant density for now, otherwise overwrite with advection_flux_transient_varying_rho specifically
# similar to the proceedure as used in conservation.arb
