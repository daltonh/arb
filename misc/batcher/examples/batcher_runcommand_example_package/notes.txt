This is an example of how to run a script from arb_batcher.

For this example three sequential runs were performed with the output from each feeding the input of the next.  This particular case was run using arb v0.55.

The files are:

1.  batcher_runcommand shell script that runs the simulations.  Note that this script picks up if there is an error in one of the simulations and halts.
2.  the arb input files
3.  batcher_setup.pm

This file is taken from my directory: /Users/daltonh/codes/arb/bone/mesh_tests_090516/arb_develop.

This example does not contain the mesh files etc required to perform this simulation, but is just included to show how to get batcher to call a script.
