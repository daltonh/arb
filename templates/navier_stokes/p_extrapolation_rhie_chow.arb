MARKDOWN
Here we link the pressure gradient (contained within <dynamic_force_f>) to the boundary velocity using the previously calculated rhie-chow interpolation terms

Note that the <u_f_{correction}> term is based on <p_error>, which for boundary cells equates to the difference between <dynamic_force_f> and <dynamic_force_c> (component) evaluated in the downcell, as celldiv applied in a boundary cell automatically takes its value from the adjacent domain cell.

FACE_EQUATION <equation> "<u_f>-faceave[downcell](dot(<u_f_vect[l=:]>,cellave[lastface](<facenorm[l=:]>)))-<u_f_{correction}>" ON <region> # pressure gradient next to wall set so that dynamic pressure gradient inext to wall is zero

# in order to do this, we have to calculate some variables on the boundary faces that were previously only calculated on <domainfaces>
VARIABLE <p_error> ON <allfaces> output
VARIABLE <dot_facenorm_facedxunit> ON <allfaces> output
VARIABLE <u_f_{correction}> ON <allfaces>
