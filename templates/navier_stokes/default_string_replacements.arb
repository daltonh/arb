MARKDOWN
These strings are the defaults used by the navier-stokes templates files if not explicitly set by the user
They specify a steady-state solution to the navier-stokes equations, with uniform viscosity and density

Some of these use both comment and flag type variables, requires three things to be set for each option

# previously pressure extrapolation on any boundaries was accomplished by setting <dynamic_force_f> to zero.  Now the default is the following, which implements a rhie-chow type pressure interpolation on the walls and at fully-developed ports (see p_extrapolation_rhie_chow.arb for more info)
