# this isn't stable 
# there is a coupling between the continuity and momentum equations which this doesn't represent - it is only based on the momentum equation that already has the incompressibility equation incorporate (ie, the viscous stress is a laplacian)
# not worked out for reflection yet

TODO - NOT WORKED OUT FOR REFLECTION YET - THIS WILL FLAG AN ERROR
