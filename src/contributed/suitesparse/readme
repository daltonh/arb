Overview:

This directory is concerned with the suitesparse UMFPACK sparse linear solver written by Prof. Tim Davis.  UMFPACK is written in c.  See:
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/
UMFPACK is released under the GNU GPL (see http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/current/.

UMFPACK depends on `METIS - Serial Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix Ordering'.  See:
http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
METIS is freely available.  See http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/faq?q=metis/metis/faq#distribute for conditions.

Install:

The installation process for the UMFPACK/METIS combination has been automated so that it can be easily used with arb.  To install these packages and compile them in a form that is suitable for arb:

1) cd src/contributed/suitesparse
2) make

The make command will download a compatible version of UMFPACK and version 4.0 of METIS (using curl), and then compile these libraries using the gcc compiler.  A wrapper script for using UMFPACK from fortran (included with UMFPACK) will also be compiled.  The files will be placed in the src/contributed/suitesparse directory, so will not overwrite any alternative suitesparse or metis libraries already on your system.

If all goes well the following files will be placed in src/contributed/suitesparse to be used by arb:
libamd.a
libcamd.a
libccolamd.a
libcholmod.a
libcolamd.a
libmetis.a
libumfpack.a
umf4_f77wrapper.o

Note that the compilation is mach_type dependent and the libraries will need to be remade if transferred from one machine to another - do a make clean and then a make.

Uninstall:

To remove the compiled libraries and files type

make clean

This will leave only the downloaded files (ready to be reused).  To remove the suitesparse and metis downloads as well, type

make clean_all
