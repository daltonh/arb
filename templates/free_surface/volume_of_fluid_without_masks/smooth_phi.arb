# smoothing phi based on a single faceseparation loop

# too much smoothing of [r=0] (used in surface tension) causes interface instability
# too little smoothing of [r=0] (used in surface tension) results in large velocity errors (parasitic currents)
# unstructured mesh results:
# with vof_smoothing_power = 1 and vof_smoothing_constant = 1, interface is stable, but on single cell level has some osciallations
# with vof_smoothing_power = 2 and vof_smoothing_constant = 1, interface is smooth and stable, but currents higher than the above
# with vof_smoothing_power = 1, vof_smoothing_constant = 0.25 and maxseparation=3,faceseparation, seems to be stable with reasonably low currents
# structured mesh results:
# maxseparation=2,faceseparation is OK for KERNEL polynomialorder=1 (ie, the default) - for higher order need to expand maxseparation (although doesn't really improve accuracy much)
# <vof_smoothing_constant> = 0.1 seems to be a good compromise between stability and accuracy on structured meshes using hyperbolic + sqrt kernel
