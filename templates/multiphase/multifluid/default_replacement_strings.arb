# <<implicitadvection>> modifies both the advection of phi and u, making both implicit (ie, using r=0 values rather than r=1 values).  You need implicit advection to be able to push CFL over 1.
GLOBAL_REPLACEMENTS D "<<implicitadvection>>" W "1" # default is now implicit advection

#GLOBAL_REPLACEMENTS D "<<stress_method>>" W "version1" # method, with phi inside viscous stress divergence
GLOBAL_REPLACEMENTS D "<<stress_method>>" W "version2" # as per jackson98 and zhang97, have phi outside of stress divergence, version2 default = zhang97 = jackson98 = balls

# default hindered settling function is now as defined in masliyah79 = balls
# version1 gives an equivalent hindered settling function which is / phi_0^2
GLOBAL_REPLACEMENTS D "<<drag_method>>" W "version2"
