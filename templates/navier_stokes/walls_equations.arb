MARKDOWN
Sets basic names etc for a wall, and only specifies the boundary normal method

Use the template "walls" instead of calling this directly

# use rhiechow
# in v0.59 changed to default on 24/9/18 due to much better velocity and pressure distribution along slip walls in transient_flow_around_cylinder_with_species
#REPLACEMENTS D "<<boundary_normal_method>>" W "rhiechow"

# use zerodynamic
REPLACEMENTS D "<<boundary_normal_method>>" W "zerodynamic"
# in v0.61 (31/3/19) changed back to zerodynamic for the default BC, based on slight better convergence under gun-compiler for turbulent_channel_containing_cylinder_2d
