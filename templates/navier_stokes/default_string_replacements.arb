MARKDOWN
These strings are the defaults used by the navier-stokes templates files if not explicitly set by the user
They specify a steady-state solution to the navier-stokes equations, with uniform viscosity and density

Some of these use both comment and flag type variables, requires three things to be set for each option

# note, both of these now require the three strings to be set - this is awkward, so instead can set these using the nonuniform_viscosity and nonuniform_density files templates

# by default pressure extrapolation on the boundary is accomplished by setting <dynamic_force_f> to zero.  Use the following to implement rhie-chow type pressure interpolation on the walls and at fully-developed ports (see p_extrapolation.arb for more info)
