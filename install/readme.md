To install arb you need to run one of the install_dependencies_* scripts contained within this directory.  For osx, you need to install Xcode and macports before running the script - see instructions contained within the osx script.

After the relevant install_dependencies_* script has run, next run the install_globally.sh script to setup your path and install any additional linear solvers.

If you are a vim user you may also like to setup code syntax highlighting using the instructions within vim_syntax.
