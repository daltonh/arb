CONSTANT <turb_sigma_k> 1.d0
CONSTANT <turb_C_D> 0.08d0

# these are some numerical constants
# proportion of uniform, steady-state solution (based on approximated strain rate) to use initially
CONSTANT <turb_k_rel_initial> 1.d+0
# proportion of uniform, steady-state solution (based on approximated strain rate) to use at inlet
CONSTANT <turb_k_rel_inlet> 1.d+0
# minimum strain rate squared to be used in production term, as a proportion of some order of magnitude of the strain rate squared within the domain
CONSTANT <turb_2SS_rel_min> 1.d-2
# how low k that is used in some of the equations is allowed to be, relative to the steady-state, uniform value
# if <turb_k_lower_lim_error> > 0 this parameter needs to be reduced
# 0 = no limit to how low k can be (ie, >0)
# 1 = limit of guaranteed numerical stability
# 3 = effective k is not allowed to fall below the local dissipation=generation amount
CONSTANT <turb_k_rel_lower> 2.d-1
# this specifies how much lower the k used in mu can be than k_lower.  In practive for small <k_rel_lower> this needs to be 1 for reliable convergence.
CONSTANT <turb_mu_rel_limit> 1.0d0
# advection limiter used in the turbulence equations
CONSTANT <turb_adv_limiter> 0.d0

# for now this just cancels the general variable property replacements done in constants.arb
GENERAL_REPLACEMENTS CANCEL "<mu_f>" # as viscosity now varies
