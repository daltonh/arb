# here we set <<replacement_variables>> to be a list of all variables used in these implicit advection routines
# used when setting suffixes etc
# note that a 'SUBSTITUTE' replacement is used, requiring that this variable be in the scope of one of the calling blocks (files)
# this is processed as a variablelist, which is space delimited, but does not actually require the quotes
