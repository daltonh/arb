These template files are for constructing the Navier-Stokes or Stokes equations.

The layout of these files for a steady-state Navier-Stokes simulation can be visualised as the following, where | represents the include of another templates file and any variable names (just the major ones) specify where these are defined:

complete -> | constants -> | <mu>
                           | <rho>
                           | etc
            | complete_equations -> | domain -> | unknowns -> | <p>
                                                              | <u>
                                                | totalstress -> | u_gradient_tensor
                                                                 | <tau>
                                                | u_f -> | p_error -> | dynamic_force -> | <p_f>
                                                                                         | <dynamic_force_c>

                                                                      | <dynamic_force_f>
                                                                      | <p_error>

                                                | momentum_flux -> | <J_f>
                                                | conservation -> | <continuity>
                                                                  | <momentum>

                                           | <inlet flowrate equation>
                                           | etc
            | walls -> | no_flux

The Stokes equations can be solved by replacing u_f with u_f_stokes and advection_flux with advection_flux_stokes.  Alternatively, replacing domain with domain_stokes (which just does these two changes).

These can now be used for any combination of dimensions, by replacing the flags <<dim1comment>>, <<dim2comment>> and <<dim3comment>> either by an empty character (if the dimension is relevant) or a comment character # (if the dimension is not relevant).  Cylindrical coordinates can also be done - using the templates in the general template directory is the easiest way to do this.
