MARKDOWN
Here we average the cell centred pressure <p> to the faces producing <p_f>.  The standard method is to use arithmetic averaging, as in

```arb
FACE_DERIVED <p_f> "faceave(<p>)" ON <allfaces>
```

Low order averaging adjacentcell averaging use a distance weighted average of the adjacent cell values.  Select this by setting
```arb
REPLACEMENTS R "<<pfadjacentcells>>" W "1"
```

High order adjacentcell averaging is as per low order adjacentcell averaging, except that the gradient within each cell is used to get a better estimate of the pressure on each side of the interface.  The amount of gradient used is set by `<p_f_grad_limiter>` which should be between 0.d0 (low order) and 1.d0 after the file is included.  To use this high order averaging set
```arb
REPLACEMENTS R "<<pfadjacentcells>>" W "1"
NONE_CONSTANT <p_f_gradient_limiter> 1.d0 # keep this between 0.d0 and 1.d0
```
END_MARKDOWN

# this is the default pressure interpolation
FACE_DERIVED <p_f> "faceave(<p>)" ON <allfaces>

# the following are based on averaging from the adjacentcells only, but possibly using high order averaging
REPLACEMENTS D "<<pfadjacentcells>>" W "0" D "<<pfadjacentcellshighorder>>" W "0"

    IF 1
      VARIABLE <p_f> "faceif(facedelta(<boundaries>),<p>,<p_f>)" # special case boundary face pressure value to be equal to boundary cell value.  Without this the boundary pressure will be equally weighted.
