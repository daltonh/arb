This directory concerns the sparse matrix solver written by kundert@users.sourceforge.net and referenced here:
http://sparse.sourceforge.net/documentation.html

The solver (library) is written in C so the sparse_module.f90 code includes some fortran/c interoperability constructs (ouch!).  Right now the libraries are compiled with gcc and do not support openmp (I tried passing in this option but it made no difference).

To enable this library you should be able to just pass the option '--sparse' to the arb script (default is --no-sparse).  This will trigger a download of the libraries to this contributed/sparse directory and compilation into the source, producing sparse/lib/libsparse.a which is linked to the main arb executable.
