these are some vim syntax files that were originally written by Christian (Biscombe) to do syntax highlighting of the arb files.

This can be setup using a shell script which does the things listed in this file.  Just run './install_vim_syntax_files.sh' and then restart vim.

Alternatively, read below to find out the details:

To set this up:
1. Move the attached files to the appropriate subdirectories within ~/.vim/ (ftplugin and syntax, respectively; create these if they don't exist) (from here, rsync -au arb_vim_files/* ~/.vim)
2. Make sure you have 'filetype plugin on' in your .vimrc
3. Append the following line to the end of your arb input file (NB spaces are significant):
# vim: ft=arb

OR

use the following in your .vimrc file 'autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.arb set filetype=arb'
4. Restart vim and hey presto!

New quick instructions:
1) mkdir ~/.vim # if this doesn't exist already
2) rsync -au arb_vim_files/* ~/.vim # copy over the relevant files
3) place the following in your .vimrc file
filetype plugin on
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.arb set filetype=arb
syntax enable
