MARKDOWN
Calculate the symmetric strain rate for each species, including the mixture.

Whether variables are DERIVED or LOCALs (ie, whether evaluated and stored at each iteration, or just available as locals) depends on the <<stress_method>> type, which should be defined

Does not refer to navier_stokes templates anymore.
