# include this file for the boundary conditions on <ls> if there is a centreline

# At a centreline the gradient of <ls> should be set to zero, in a manner that is consistent with the mod(grad(<ls>)) calc
# here high order differencing should be used right up to the boundary - so don't include the centreline in the <walls> region used in the calculation of <ls_reinitialisation_order_walls>
