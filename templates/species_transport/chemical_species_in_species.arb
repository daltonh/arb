MARKDOWN
This for the transport of chemcial species <<chemical_species>> that is attached to (on) or within (in) a multifluid species <<species>>

Variables in this file end with the suffix <<chemical_species>>_[on|in]_<<species>> with the on/in choice reflecting whether the chemical species is contained on the surface of the (multifluid) species (on), or within its volume (in).

Where the chemical species is to be defined on the species is determined by the <<where>>=volume|surface which should be previously set, but defaults to volume.
Alternatively, for a surface bound species call with the template chemical_species_on_species
END_MARKDOWN
