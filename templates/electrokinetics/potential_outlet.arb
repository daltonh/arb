# these equations need <outlet>, <outlet centreline> and <outlet sans centreline> to be defined, by (eg)
#FACE_REGION <outlet centreline> "AT 0.d0 0.d0 0.d0 PART OF <outlet>"
#FACE_REGION <outlet sans centreline> "COMPOUND <outlet>-<outlet centreline>"

# set uniform potential gradient over outlet to the gradient that exists in the centreline
NONE_DERIVED <outlet centreline gradU> "facesum(facegrad(<U>),region=<outlet centreline>)" # find the potential gradient near the centreline as a variable with no centring
FACE_EQUATION <outlet potential equation> "facegrad(<U>)-<outlet centreline gradU>" ON <outlet sans centreline>

# and set the average potential at the outlet to zero
#NONE_DERIVED <outlet average U> "facesum(<U>*<facearea>,<outlet>)/facesum(<facearea>,<outlet>)" # find the average potential over the whole outlet
#NONE_EQUATION <outlet centreline potential equation> "<outlet average U>" # and set this to zero

# or set potential at centreline to zero
NONE_EQUATION <outlet centreline potential equation> "facesum(<U>,region=<outlet centreline>)" # use this none centred form so that if this equation has to be overwritten, the overwritten equation can be none centred (eg, specify total current)
