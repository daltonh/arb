A number of stars have to align to be able to use this solver
* On osx, it is only available using the gnu (gfortran) compiler
* On linux, it is available for both gfortran and ifort (intel) compilers (although the iterative solver doesn't seem to work under gfortran on linux)
* You need to download the relevant libraries for your compiler and architecture from http://www.pardiso-project.org and place it this directory (src/contributed/pardiso)'
* You also need to download a license file (filename = pardiso.lic) from http://www.pardiso-project.org which will be specific to your username.  You have a few options of where to put this licence file:
  - in your run directory
  - in this directory (src/contributed/pardiso), although obviously you need to own this directory to do this (in practice)
  - specify its location when running arb, using the --pardiso-lic-path option
  - set the environment variable PARDISO_LIC_PATH within your shell to point to the licence file's location

Note: if you have the required pardiso libraries and license file for the architecture that you're on, you won't be able to use the intel MKL pardiso solver (which is much older) anymore under ifort unless you specifically tell arb that you don't want the newer native pardiso solvers linked in.  To do this (ie, use the intel pardiso solver rather than the native pardiso solver) pass arb the --no-pardiso option.
