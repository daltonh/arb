MARKDOWN
Here we choose how p on boundary cells should be extrapolated from the domain values.  With <<pextrapolation>> = rhiechow the local boundary pressure gradient is used to couple the boundary velocity to the velocity in the (closest) adjacent domain cell using terms derived for the (within domain) rhie-chow interpolation method.  The alternative is to just set <dynamic_force_f> on the boundary to zero (<<pextrapolation>> = zerodynamic), which for no body forces implies that the boundary-evaluated pressure gradient is set to zero.
