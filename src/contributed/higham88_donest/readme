donest.f is a double precision edit of the sonest.f routine by higham (1988) described in the following publication:

Nicholas J. Higham. 1988. FORTRAN codes for estimating the one-norm of a real or complex matrix, with applications to condition estimation. ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 14, 4 (December 1988), 381-396. DOI=10.1145/50063.214386 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/50063.214386

To create donest.f:

1) type `make' from this directory.  The program curl must be installed.

2) Next time arb is run donest.f will be compiled and the condition number estimator will be included in the arb fortran executable.  Set logical variable condition_number_estimate to true in solver_module.f90 to calculate the Jacobian matrix condition number estimate at each run.  Doing this will probably about double the time for a simulation to run.
