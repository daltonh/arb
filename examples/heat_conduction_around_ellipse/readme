to run this example problem (assuming that you have all of the required software installed - see the website or manual within doc)

1) copy all of the problem files (.arb, .msh and .geo) from this directory to the working directory.  IE, from this directory:
cp *.arb ../..
cp *.geo ../..
cp *.msh ../..

2) change directory back to the working directory:
cd ../..

3) run the simulation
./arb

3.5) if arb complains that you don't have a linear solver installed at this point you can download and install the suitsparse solver and try again using:
cd src/contributed/suitesparse
make
cd ../../..
./arb

4) view the simulation results using gmsh:
gmsh output/output.msh

The directory tutorial_2 contains a more complex problem but the run method is the same as above.  You will need to delete the tutorial_1 *.arb file before running it however (or specify the new *.arb file explicitly to the ./arb run script).  There are many other example files within the examples directory.
