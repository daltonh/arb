MARKDOWN
The mesh quality template examines the basic geometric parameters of the cells, calculating:
1. <cell aspect ratio> is the largest face that surrounds a cell divided the smallest face from around that cell.  This parameter is calculated for all <domain> cells, and should be close to 1 everywhere.
2. <cell adjacent volume ratio> is the ratio of adjacent cell volumes for each face between domain cells (<domainfaces>).  This parameter should be near 1 everywhere.

TODO: look at notes and improve these explanations
The kernel parameters template looks at the quality of the kernels generated on the mesh.  The following parameters are defined in terms of the contribution from surrounding cells to the calculation of a face value, in the context of advection stability (need to check notes here).  Specifically the following are calculated:
1. <crosskernel output> (definition: cross_kernel = maxval(abs(temporary_kernel(jj)%v(2:ubound(temporary_kernel(jj)%v,1)))))  Cross_kernel is the maximum kernel element that goes to make up delphi, except for the central element.  From memory in an ideal case this should be maximum 0.5, with larger values representing a problem.
2. <centralkernel output> (definition: central_kernel = abs(temporary_kernel(jj)%v(1)))  Central_kernel is the contribution from the central cell.  This should be zero ideally.
3. <kernelsum output> (definition: kernel_sum = sum(abs(temporary_kernel(jj)%v)))  Should be zero?

# now try doing corrections to face centred kernels
MARKDOWN
These parameters are attempts are correcting the stability characteristics of the face centred kernels, at the expense of formal polynomial order accuracy.  As this is only applied to face centred kernels, will not affect the above advection based kernel parameters.
