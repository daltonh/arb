* exclude working_dir and code_scraps from makefile html targets
* create a template page and link to that - for now it includes static list of toc pages, detailed to possibly be replaced later by local TOC
* create a contents maker script, which tailors the contents to each page, and includes it as the index.html
* infact, this runs pandoc itself
