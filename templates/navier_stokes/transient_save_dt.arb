# this section just re-works the implicit timestepping equation to allow a newtstepmax to be applied to <dt_target>
# save a derived copy of <dt_target> after <u_f> has been calculated so that we can apply newtstepmax to it
# this string will already have been set to 1 (as a general replacement) in transient_all_setup if this option is relevant
# this is the default behaviour when using implicit dynamic timestepping
