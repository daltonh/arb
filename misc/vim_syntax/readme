these are some vim syntax files that were originally written by Christian (Biscombe).

To set this up:
1. Move the attached files to the appropriate subdirectories within ~/.vim/ (ftplugin and syntax, respectively; create these if they don't exist)
2. Make sure you have 'filetype plugin on' in your .vimrc
3. Append the following line to the end of your arb input file (NB spaces are significant):
# vim: ft=arb

OR

use the following in your .vimrc file 'autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.arb set filetype=arb'
4. Restart vim and hey presto!
