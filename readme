originally written by Dalton Harvie (daltonh@unimelb.edu.au), this is now a public collaborative project

* to run the solver you use the ./arb script
* try ./arb --help to list available options
* scripts in the install directory automate the process of installing dependent software/packages, as well as installing arb for running outside of this arb directory
* to get going, look at the readme file in the examples/tutorial_1 directory or at the manual in the doc directory
