MARKDOWN
Use this template file to multiply (or optionally add, divide, subtract etc) a comma separated list of variables (contained within <<list of variables>>) by something else, contained in <<multiplier>>

To use this for another arithmetic operation, set <<operator>> to the required operator, eg

```arb
REPLACEMENTS R '<<operator>>' W '+' # for addition
```
END_MARKDOWN

REPLACEMENTS D '<<list of variables>>' W '' # these are the variables you want operated on
REPLACEMENTS D '<<multiplier>>' W '1.d0' # this is what they are going to be multiplied with
REPLACEMENTS D '<<operator>>' W '*' # this is the operation being performed
IF <<list of variables>>
  {{
    my $return_string='';
    for my $v (string_eval('<<list of variables>>','list')) {
      $return_string .= "VARIABLE $v '($v) <<operator>> (<<multiplier>>)'\n";
    }
    return $return_string;
  }}
END_IF
