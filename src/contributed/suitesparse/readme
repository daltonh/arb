Overview:

This directory is concerned with the suitesparse UMFPACK sparse linear solver written by Prof. Tim Davis.  UMFPACK is written in c.  See:
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/
UMFPACK is released under the GNU GPL (see http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/current/.

To use umfpack we now use the fortran 90 interface module from here
http://geo.mff.cuni.cz/~lh/Fortran/UMFPACK/
This wrapper file should be automatically downloaded as part of the arb run procedure if system-wide umfpack libraries are available.  For more details on how to install these libraries see the misc/install_dependencies directory.
