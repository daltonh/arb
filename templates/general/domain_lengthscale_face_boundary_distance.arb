# find an estimate of the domain size
# here we use a more accurate estimate of the domain size based on minimum_face_boundary_distance (used in electrokinetic routines for example)
INCLUDE "minimum_face_boundary_distance" # this will find a constant vector domain length in each dimension
CONSTANT <a_lengthscale> "cellmax(<minimum_face_boundary_distance>,region=<domain>)" # an estimate of the mesh lengthscale (channel half-width) based on the minimum domain -> wall distance
