<div class="level2">

<p>
arb solves arbitrary partial differential equations on unstructured meshes using the finite volume method.  The code is written in fortran95, with some meta-programming done in perl with help from maxima.
</p>

<p>
The primary strengths of arb are:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> All equations and variables are defined using `maths-type&#039; expressions written by the user, and hence can be easily tailored to each application;</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> All equations are solved simultaneously using a Newton-Raphson method, so implicitly discretised equations can be solved efficiently; and</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The unstructured mesh over which the equations are solved can be componsed of all sorts of convex polygons/polyhedrons.</div>
</li>
</ul>
