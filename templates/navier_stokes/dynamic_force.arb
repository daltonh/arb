MARKDOWN
dynamic force is the pressure force that could cause fluid movement
it is added directly to the momentum equations, and used in calculating p_error used in the face velocity interpolation
dynamic force now has the physically correct sign!
The pressure gradient is calculated via a divergence (consistent with momentum conservation) (on boundary cells values from the adjacent domain cells will be used)

<dynamic_force_f> is calculated at the same time as <p_error>, within p_error.arb, which this file is called from

Other dynamic_force templates (eg, vof, electrokinetics) increment <dynamic_force_c[l=:]> set in this file, as well as <dynamic_force_f>
