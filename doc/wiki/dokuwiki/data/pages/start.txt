===== What is arb? =====

arb solves arbitrary partial differential equations on unstructured meshes using the finite volume method.  The code is written in fortran95, with some meta-programming done in perl with help from maxima.

The primary strengths of arb are:
  * All equations and variables are defined using `maths-type' expressions written by the user, and hence can be easily tailored to each application;
  * All equations are solved simultaneously using a Newton-Raphson method, so implicitly discretised equations can be solved efficiently; and
  * The unstructured mesh over which the equations are solved can be componsed of all sorts of convex polygons/polyhedrons.

===== What is needed to run arb? =====

arb requires a UNIX type environment to run, and has been tested on both the Apple OsX and ubuntu linux platforms. Certain third party programs are used by arb:
  * A fortran compiler; ifort and gfortran are supported;
  * The computer algebra system [[http://maxima.sourceforge.net|maxima]];
  * A sparse matrix linear solver: [[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/|UMFPACK]], [[http://www.pardiso-project.org/|pardiso]], and (currently a single) Harwell Subroutine Library routines are supported; and
  * The mesh generator [[http://geuz.org/gmsh/|gmsh]]

Further details about how to install arb are given in [[Installation]].
