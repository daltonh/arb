MARKDOWN
Transport equations for a generic species c in a channel that may have nonuniform width, originally developed in the context of doing a4f simulations
On entry, replace /species/ by the name of the species that you want to solve (defaulting to species0).
For limited advection, make sure that you set <c magnitude_/species/> so that the advection routine works correctly.
